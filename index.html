        Board games date back a very long time. The very first board game was
        quite possibly a dice game from around 5000BC, found at the Başur Höyük
        burial mound in southeast Turkey. In Ancient Egypt, Senet (~3000BC) was
        popular amongst pharaohs. Other games in ancient times include, but are
        not limited to Backgammon (~2000BC) from Mesopotamia, Go (~2000BC) from
        China, and Hounds and Jackals (~2000BC), also from Ancient Egypt. This
        chart shows a history of board game publication counts by year, and has
        some interesting facts along the timeline. Hover over a point to learn

        Board games can have a domain or even multiple, but the most common
        would have to be strategy and family games. One of the available
        functions of being a member of the BoardGameGeek community is to be able
        to report what games you own. Below is a chart showing the kind of board
        games people own, grouped by the minimum recommended age of those games.
        Makes sense that most family games recommend children of ages 5+ for
        their games, and it seems interesting that many strategy games and
        thematic games that people own tend to be for ages 12 and up.

        Is the difficulty of learning and playing a board game linked in any way
        to the overall rating of a board game? This chart seems to show a very
        slight trend in which complexity might have a positive effect on rating,
        but it's nothing conclusive. Still, it's interesting to be able to
        filter through the mechanics of the games and check if there might be
        some correlation within a single mechanic group. Hover over a point to
        see the name of the game as well as the year it was published.
